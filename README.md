# task.bash — Harmonize Your Unix Work Environments with Idempotent Tasks

![version](assets/version.svg) ![lines](assets/lines.svg) ![tests](assets/tests.svg) ![coverage](assets/coverage.svg)

Create a configuration script that follows you across machines. Use shell-native tasks that keep your systems consistent, idempotent, and version-controlled — all in plain Bash.

**Requires Bash 5**

## 🧭 Why task.bash?

System configuration tools like Make, Ansible, or shell scripts often fall short when your needs include:

- Working directly in Bash (no YAML, no extra tooling)
- Controlling shell-level constructs like `source` or `PATH`
- Ensuring every task is **idempotent** (run it once or 100 times — same result)
- Curl-pipeable bootstrapping from GitHub for new machines
- Declarative task structure, driven by your script as the **source of truth**

Use it to:

- Install software
- Clone git repositories
- Make symlinks
- Change directory ownership
- … or anything else shell scripts are good at

Other features:

- Output suppression and concise status lines
- Progress display for long-running commands
- Summarized reports at the end of the run
- Simple user prompting (e.g., for passwords)
- Ad-hoc scripting support

## 📦 Installation

Clone or copy `task.bash` to a location where your configuration script can source it:

```bash
# Option 1: Local sourcing
git clone https://github.com/binaryphile/task.bash
source ./task.bash

# Option 2: Curl-pipe it in
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binaryphile/task.bash/main/task.bash -o task.bash
source ./task.bash
```

You may also **vendor it inline** by pasting the contents of `task.bash` into your config script in place of the `source` line.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

`task.bash` introduces the concept of a **task** — a Bash function designed to be **idempotent**.

**Idempotent** means the system ends up in the same desired state whether the task is run once or many times. Since raw shell commands aren't naturally idempotent, task.bash gives you tools to make them so.

---

## 🧱 Anatomy of a Task

Here's the minimal structure of a task:

```bash
cloneDotfilesTask() {
  desc  'clone my dotfiles'
  ok    '[[ -e ~/dotfiles ]]'
  cmd   'git clone git@github.com:user/dotfiles ~/dotfiles'
}
```

This task will:

- Clone the user's dotfiles into `~/dotfiles` **if** that directory doesn't already exist
- Report `[changed]` if run
- Report `[ok]` if skipped due to the `ok` condition

### Keyword Breakdown

| Keyword | Role |
|---------|------|
| `desc`  | Human-readable description for status output |
| `ok`    | Bash condition to skip running the task if already satisfied |
| `cmd`   | Command to run if `ok` fails; must be last in the function |

The `cmd` line triggers the actual execution and finalizes the task definition. All keywords must appear **before** it.

> ⚠️ `cmd` and `ok` both evaluate strings. Be cautious with user input. Do not interpolate user-supplied values into these fields.

---

## 🧰 Additional Task Keywords

Other optional keywords you can use in a task:

| Keyword | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `exist PATH` | Shortcut for `ok` with `[[ -e PATH ]]` |
| `prog on|off` | Show live command output |
| `runas USER` | Run command with `sudo -u USER` |
| `unchg TEXT` | Look for `TEXT` in output; if found, mark as `[ok]` instead of `[changed]` |

We'll explore each of these in examples below.

---

## 🧠 task.bash Functions

The keywords (`desc`, `ok`, `cmd`, etc.) are Bash functions used within task definitions. Additional helper functions are provided under the `task.` namespace:

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `task.Platform` | Returns `macos` or `linux` |
| `task.Summarize` | Displays summary of task run outcomes |
| `task.SetShortRun on|off` | Skips long-running tasks with `prog` or `unchg` |

These use **PascalCase** with a `task.` prefix to avoid namespace conflicts in your shell environment.

---

## 🧩 Configuration Script Outline

A typical script using task.bash has two parts: define tasks, then run them.

Here’s a minimal example (`update-env`):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

main() {
  set -euo pipefail       # Enable strict mode
  cloneDotfilesTask
  task.Summarize
}

cloneDotfilesTask() {
  desc  'clone my dotfiles'
  ok    '[[ -e ~/dotfiles ]]'
  cmd   'git clone git@github.com:user/dotfiles ~/dotfiles'
}

source ./task.bash
main
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x update-env
./update-env
```

### What You'll See

```bash
[changed]       clone my dotfiles
[summary]
ok:      0
changed: 1
```

- Output is color-coded (green for `[ok]`/`[changed]`, red for `[failed]`)
- Command output is hidden unless `prog on` is used
- A `[begin]` line is briefly shown while a command is running, then overwritten

Run the script again and it will skip the task:

```bash
[ok]           clone my dotfiles
```

If a command fails or its `ok` condition still fails afterward, the task is marked `[failed]`, and the script stops.

---

## 🛠 Defining More Tasks

### 🧪 Speculative Commands (e.g., package upgrades)

These don’t know in advance if they’ll make a change — they depend on external state (e.g. package manager cache).

```bash
aptUpgradeTask() {
  desc  'upgrade system packages'
  prog  on
  runas root
  unchg '0 upgraded, 0 newly installed'
  cmd   'apt update -qq && apt upgrade -y'
}
```

Explanation:

- `prog on` — enables live output
- `runas root` — executes via `sudo`
- `unchg` — checks for output suggesting no changes, and maps it to `[ok]`

---

### 🧰 Complex Tasks (e.g., downloads, setup)

```bash
curlTask() {
  desc   'download coolscript from github'
  exist  ~/.local/bin/coolscript
  cmd    '
    mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
    curl -fsSL https://github.com/user/coolscript > ~/.local/bin/coolscript
  '
}
```

- Use multi-line strings with `cmd` to group setup logic
- Prefer `exist` over `ok` for simple file checks

---

### 🔁 Parameterized Tasks

```bash
mkdirTask() {
  local dir=$1
  desc "make directory $dir"

  mkdirP() { mkdir -p "$dir"; }
  cmd mkdirP
}
```

This approach avoids quoting pitfalls and enables reuse.

- Define a **local wrapper function** like `mkdirP` inside the task
- It acts like a closure, capturing arguments via Bash’s dynamic scoping

Use it like this:

```bash
mkdirTask ~/.config/myapp
```

You can write parameterized tasks this way with full quoting and evaluation control.

---

## 📄 Example: update-env

See the `update-env` script in this repo for a real-world example.

It:

- Manages dotfiles, packages, and symlinks
- Uses `task.bash` to stay declarative and idempotent
- Bootstraps clean machines via curl-pipe from GitHub

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your/repo/main/update-env)
```

When used alongside tools like **Nix** and **home-manager**, it gives a full declarative system that works offline and in any shell-native workflow.

---

## 🧪 Summary

`task.bash` is ideal when:

- You want to control system config via shell, not YAML
- You care about reproducibility across machines
- You need idempotency and progress visibility in Bash
- You don’t want to adopt heavyweight tools just to manage a few settings
